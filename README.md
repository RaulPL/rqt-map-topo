# rqt-map-topo

This plugin was designed to help users that want to label poses (x, y, yaw) in an occupancy grid. The user interface has options to load a map from the map_server and to store the desired locations in a configuration file (yaml).

You can use it from rqt by adding the plugin or you can run the following command in a terminal:

    $ rqt --standalone rqt_map_topo
